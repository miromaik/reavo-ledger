Main Services Agreement
Last Updated: April 25, 2023
The Main Services Agreement and the Slack Supplemental Terms (together, the "Slack Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities when using our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the “Services”).
If you are “Customer”, the Slack Terms govern your access to and use of our Services. If you are being invited to a workspace set up by Customer, the User Terms of Service (the “User Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Services.
