Customer terms of service
Summary of these Terms
Along with the Terms on this page, two other documents form part of our contract with you:
- Our How we Work page helps you use our Platform and understand our reviews, rankings, recommendations, how we make money, and more.
- Our Content Standards and Guidelines help us keep everything on our Platform relevant to and appropriate for our global audience without limiting freedom of expression. They tell you how we manage content and online safety and take action against anything inappropriate.
By agreeing to our Terms, you agree to everything in all three documents. If you don’t accept any of these Terms, please do not use our Platform.
All this information is important because it (along with your booking confirmation email and any pre-contractual information provided before you book) sets out the legal terms on which Service Providers offer their Travel Experiences through our Platform.
If something goes wrong with your Travel Experience, Section A16 of these Terms explains what you can do about it. This includes making a complaint to us, going to court, and (in some cases) using an online dispute resolution service.
If you want to appeal to a moderation decision or report any content on our Platform, our Content Standards and Guidelines explain how to do so and how we manage these requests.
This summary isn’t part of our Terms or a legal document. It’s just a simple explanation of our Terms. We encourage you to read each document in full. Some of the words in this summary have specific meanings, so please refer to the ‘Booking.com dictionary’ at the end of these Terms.
A. All Travel Experiences
A1. Definitions
1. Some words here have specific meanings, so please refer to the ‘Booking.com dictionary’ at the end of these Terms.
A2. About these terms
1. When you complete your booking, you accept these Terms and any other terms provided during the booking process.
2. If any authority decides that some of these terms are unlawful, the rest of the terms will continue to apply.
3. These Terms are laid out like this:
- Section A: General terms for all types of Travel Experiences.
Sections B to F: Specific terms for just one type of Travel Experience:
- Section B: Accommodations
- Section C: Attractions
- Section D: Car rentals
- Section E: Flights
- Section F: Private and Public Transport
- The specific terms will apply if there’s any mismatch between general and specific terms.
4. The English version of these Terms is the original. If there’s any dispute about the Terms or any mismatch between the Terms in English and another language, the Terms as they appear in English will apply unless local law requires otherwise. (You can change the language at the top of this page.)
A3. About Booking.com
1. When you book an accommodation, flight or attraction, Booking.com B.V. provides and is responsible for the Platform – but not the Travel Experience itself (section A4.3).
2. When you book a rental car (on Booking.com or Rentalcars.com) or private or public transport, Booking.com Transport Limited provides and is responsible for the Platform – but not the Travel Experience itself (section A4.3).
3. We work with companies that provide local support services (e.g. Customer Support or account management). They don’t:
- control or manage our Platform
- have their own Platform
- have any legal or contractual relationship with you
- provide Travel Experiences
- represent us, or enter into contracts, or accept legal documents in our name
- operate as our ‘process or service agents’.
A4. Our Platform
1. We get information from Service Providers, and we can’t guarantee that everything is accurate – but when providing our Platform, we take reasonable care and act with professional diligence. Unless we’ve failed to do so or have been negligent, we can’t be held responsible for any errors, interruptions, or missing bits of information. Of course, we’ll do everything we can to correct/fix them as soon as we become aware.
2. Our Platform is not a recommendation or endorsement of any Service Provider or its products, services, facilities, vehicles, etc.
3. We’re not a party to the terms between you and the Service Provider. The Service Provider is solely responsible for the Travel Experience.
4. To make a booking, you may need to create an Account. Please make sure all your info (including payment and contact details) is correct and up to date, or you might find you can’t access your Travel Experience(s). You’re responsible for anything that happens with your Account, so please don’t let anyone else use it, and please keep your username and password secret.
5. We will show you the offers available to you in (what we think is) the right language for you. You can change to another language whenever you like.
6. Unless otherwise indicated, you must be at least 18 to use the Platform.
A5. Our values
1. You will:
- abide by Our values
- comply with all applicable laws
- cooperate with any anti-fraud/anti-money laundering checks we need to carry out
- not use the Platform to cause a nuisance or make fake bookings
- use the Travel Experience and/or Platform for their intended purpose
- not cause any nuisance or damage, and not behave inappropriately to the Service Provider’s personnel (or anyone else, for that matter).
A6. Your experience with our Platform
1. Based on your interaction with our Platform and your personalisation preferences (which you can access in your account settings under the ‘Customisation preferences’ section), we may enable features intended to make your experience more convenient and offer you tailored services (including personalised marketing messages) to enhance your experience and make it easier for you to book your ideal Travel Experience.
2. We’re always working to improve our customers’ experience with Booking.com. So, sometimes, we show different people different designs, phrasings, products, etc., to find out how they react. As a result, you might not come across some services or conditions when you visit our Platform.
A7. Prices
1. When you make a booking, you agree to pay the cost of the Travel Experience, including any charges and taxes that may apply.
2. Some of the prices may have been rounded to the nearest whole number. The price you pay will be based on the original, 'non-rounded' price (although the actual difference will be tiny anyway).
3. Obvious errors and obvious misprints are not binding. For example, if you book a premium car or a night in a luxury suite mistakenly offered for €1, your booking may be cancelled, and we’ll refund anything you’ve paid. We will remove obvious pricing errors as soon as we become aware.
4. A crossed-out price indicates the price of a like-for-like booking without the price reduction applied (‘like-for-like’ means same dates, same policies, same quality of accommodation/vehicle/class of travel, etc.).
A8. Payment
1. For some products/services, the Service Provider will require an upfront payment and/or payment during your Travel Experience.
- If we organise your payment, we (or, in some cases, our affiliate) will be responsible for managing it and ensuring the completion of your transaction with our Service Provider. In this case, your payment constitutes the final settlement of the 'due and payable' price.
- If the Service Provider charges you, this will usually be in person at the start of your Travel Experience, but it could also be, for example, that your credit card is charged when you book or you pay when you check out of your Accommodation. This depends on the Service Provider's upfront payment policy, as communicated to you in the booking process.
2. If the Service Provider requires an upfront payment, it may be taken or pre-authorised when you make your booking, and it may be non-refundable. So, before you book, please check the Service Provider’s upfront payments policy (available during the booking process), which we don’t influence and aren’t responsible for. This does not affect your rights if you have any problems with your Travel Experience – please refer to ‘What if something goes wrong?’ (A16).
3. If your payment method is denominated in a currency* different from the payment currency, your bank or payment method provider (or their payment services providers) may charge you additional fees. For example, this could happen if your credit card is in Euros, but your hotel is charging you in dollars. If this is going to happen, we’ll inform you during the booking process.
* This refers to the default currency of your payment method.
4. If you know of or suspect any fraudulent behaviour or unauthorised use of your Payment Method, please contact your payment provider as soon as possible.
5. If the currency selected on the Platform isn't the same as the Service Provider's currency, we may:
- show prices in your own currency
- offer you the Pay In Your Own Currency option.
6. Pay In Your Own Currency. We (and/or one of our affiliates) may provide you with the ability to pay for your booking in your own currency (your ‘home currency’), based on your location and/or account setting – and in respect of this service only; we do this as principal, rather than as agent for the Service Provider. Where you use this service, you agree to the following terms, which are separate to your contract with the Service Provider related to your Travel Experience. The Service Provider is not involved in the provision of the Pay In Your Own Currency service and is not party to the following terms, which do not give you any extra rights under your contract with the Service Provider. If you choose to pay in the Service Provider’s currency, the following terms don’t apply.
- For the avoidance of doubt, when you use Pay In Your Own Currency, we are simply enabling you to make payment in your own currency while we ensure that the Service Provider is paid in their local currency. As such, you are not making payment in one currency and receiving another currency.
- If you choose to use Pay In Your Own Currency, all fees and charges from us for use of the Pay In Your Own Currency service either (a) are included in the exchange rate or (b) appear as a separate line item (included in the total price displayed where applicable) during the checkout process.
- The exchange rate is determined when the total payment (or estimated total payment) is displayed during the checkout process. Where applicable, the total price displayed will be the amount charged by us to you. Certain fees and charges that are part of the total price displayed will, however, be collected directly by the Service Provider. We will tell you when this is the case during the checkout process.
- If you cancel a reservation within any permitted cancellation period which may apply, we will refund you the exact same amount we initially charged you (inclusive of any applicable fees in relation to the Pay in Your Own Currency Service).
7. After collecting your consent, We will store your payment method details for future transactions.
A9. Policies
1. When you make a booking, you accept the applicable policies as displayed in the booking process. You'll find each Service Provider's cancellation policy and any other policies (about age requirements, security/damage deposits, additional supplements for group bookings, extra beds, breakfast, pets, cards accepted, etc.) on our Platform: on the Service Provider information pages, during the booking process, in the fine print, and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable).
2. If you cancel a booking or don’t show up, any cancellation/no-show fee and any refund will depend on the Service Provider’s cancellation/no-show policy.
3. Some bookings can’t be cancelled for free, while others can only be cancelled for free before a deadline.
4. If you book a Travel Experience by paying in advance (including all price components and/or a damage deposit if applicable), the Service Provider may cancel the booking without notice if they can't collect the balance on the specified date. If they do cancel, any non-refundable payment you’ve made will only be refunded at their discretion. It's your responsibility to make sure the payment goes ahead on time (that your bank, debit card or credit card details are correct and that there's enough money available in your account).
5. If you think you're not going to arrive on time, please contact your Service Provider and tell them when they can expect you. It’s your responsibility to ensure you’re on time, and if you aren’t, we are not responsible for any associated costs (e.g. the cancellation of your booking, or any fees the Service Provider may charge).
6. As the person making the booking, you are responsible for the actions and behaviour (in relation to the Travel Experience) of everyone in the group. You are also responsible for obtaining their permission before providing us with their personal data.
A10. Privacy and cookies
1. If you book a Travel Experience, please refer to our Privacy Notice for more information on privacy, cookies, how we might contact you and how we process personal data.
2. If you are based in France and you have provided your phone number on our platform, you have the option to register your telephone details on the do-not-call list available at www.bloctel.gouv.fr.
A11. Accessibility requests
1. If you have any accessibility requests:
- about our Platform and/or services, please contact our Customer Service team
- about your Travel Experience (wheelchair access, walk-in baths, etc.), please contact your Service Provider or the airport, train station, etc.
A12. Insurance
1. If you have bought insurance through our Platform, please refer to the policy document(s) for the terms and further information. These Terms do not apply to insurance.
A13. Genius
1. The Genius rate is a discounted rate offered by participating Service Providers or funded by Booking.com for certain products/services.
2. Genius rates are for members of the Booking.com Genius programme. There are no membership fees, and it’s easy to become a member – simply create an account. Membership and rates are non-transferable. Membership is linked to a specific account. Membership can also be linked to specific campaigns or incentives.
3. There are different ‘Genius Levels’ based on the number of completed bookings made within a given period for any vertical offered by the programme. Each level provides different travel rewards. To reach Level 2, the user must complete 5 bookings within 2 years. To reach Level 3, the user must complete 15 bookings within 2 years.
4. The following types of reservations made through Booking.com are excluded from the Genius programme: Cruises, Insurance, public transport and free options. Any additional purchases such as room upgrades for stays, child seats for rental cars, and additional luggage for flights will not incur Genius discounts.
5. We may change any feature of the Genius programme, including the membership levels, eligible booking types for progression, and the way the programme is structured.
6. To ensure a fair and secure programme, we may investigate instances of fraud, misuse, or abuse. This may result in a membership being cancelled and earned rewards being lost.
7. For more details, visit https://www.booking.com/genius.html.
A14. Rewards, Credits & Wallet
1. We may issue Rewards to you – at our sole discretion, and subject to (a) the terms here in A14 and (b) any Individual Reward Criteria that apply. If we make a clerical error (i) in calculating your Rewards or (ii) in converting currencies related to your Rewards, we can always change or correct any balances shown.
2. How to get Rewards. You may, for example, earn and receive a Reward by booking and completing Accommodation stays with participating Service Providers, or by making a certain number of Eligible bookings in a given time period. Please note that the amount/quantity of Rewards earned will depend on each promotional campaign. We’ll provide details about earning/spending a Reward when it becomes available to earn and/or spend.
3. Where to find your Rewards. If and when you receive any Rewards, you will be able to manage and spend them from the Wallet, which is automatically created when you create a verified Account. You’ll find the Wallet in your Account menu, and you must be signed in to your Account to access it. If you need to do anything to receive a Reward, we’ll tell you how (through Account notifications, push notifications, and/or emails). Once you have Rewards in your Wallet, we’ll provide any terms and conditions related to spending them.
4. Types of Rewards. Although we only award (a) Credits and (b) vouchers into your Wallet, your Wallet may also help you track the processing of (c) other types of Reward (e.g. Credit Card Cashback) from us. We’ll tell you what you need to know about receiving each Reward at the appropriate time.
5. How to get Credits. Credits are usually issued as a result of getting a Reward but we may issue Credits for other reasons.
6. Where to find your Credits. Your Rewards are always stored in the Wallet until they are spent. Your Wallet balance will indicate how much is stored and spendable on Eligible bookings. You will also be able to access detailed information such as when your Rewards were earned, were awarded, and will expire. If you’re entitled to Cash Credits, you’ll also find out how to transfer them to a credit or debit card (of certain brands).
7. Types of Credits. Each Reward type has its own set of spending and/or usage conditions. In general, all Rewards can only be spent on Travel Experiences that accept Wallet payments. Travel Credits can be spent across different bookings, but vouchers can only be spent on specific bookings stated within each voucher's terms and conditions. Cash Credits can also be spent like Travel Credits or be transferred to a credit or debit card (of certain brands).
We reserve the right to audit any and all accounts in the Rewards & Wallet programme at any time and without notice to the Member, to ensure compliance with the Rewards & Wallet programme or investigate (alleged) fraud or misuse.
Rewards: eligibility
8. To be able to receive any type of Rewards from us, you must, at the time of qualification and spending:
- have a verified Account with us
- be at least 18 years old
- meet the Individual Reward Criteria
- not violate the Rewards & Wallet Terms, and
- have a valid credit card, if you need to qualify for Credit Card Cashback Rewards.
9. When a Reward is available for earning, the Individual Reward Criteria will explain how (and if) you can qualify for it. These criteria may contain and not be limited to:
- time-sensitive restrictions (e.g. offers with expiration dates)
- platform restrictions (e.g. promotional codes that can only be used in our app)
- Accommodation service restrictions (e.g. offers that can only be used with specific Service Providers)
- a minimum spend (e.g. a Reward that you’ll only earn when you spend at least a certain amount on a Booking), and
- a maximum Reward value (for both monetary and non-monetary Rewards).
10. Rewards cannot be sold, encumbered or transferred in any way to a third party. In the event of an Account holder’s death, their Account will be closed and any Rewards that are pending or available for spending in the Wallet will be cancelled.
Rewards: Credits and vouchers
11. You can spend any amount of Travel Credits and/or Cash Credits that you have to offset the cost of an Eligible booking on participating Platforms (e.g. www.booking.com or a Group Company website). However, you may only spend one voucher on each booking, and if you have multiple vouchers in your Wallet, their value cannot be combined for spending on any Booking.
12. If that booking costs less than you have in Rewards, your unspent Rewards will remain available for spending in your Wallet until expiry, unless otherwise stated in each Reward's terms and conditions.
13. If that Travel Experience costs more than you have in Rewards, you must make payment for the remaining amount using a different Payment Method. Failure to do so in time may result in your booking being cancelled, and your Rewards returned to your Wallet with the original Reward terms and conditions, including expiration dates.
14. You may spend both Credits and vouchers at the same time on any Eligible bookings. We do our best to unlock the most savings for you, but it is your sole responsibility to manage how the Rewards are spent. If you have multiple Rewards of a single type, the Reward with the earliest expiration date will be selected for spending by default during payment confirmation. While you may not choose Credits with later expiration dates to spend first, you are free to choose the voucher you prefer to spend first.
15. If you cancel a Travel Experience that you have already paid for (in part or in full) with Rewards, the Service Provider’s cancellation policy will determine whether or not your money and/or Rewards are refunded. Our Customer Service team will be able to refund any Rewards that you may be entitled to.
16. You can transfer Cash Credits (but not Travel Credits) to a credit or debit card of certain brands.
17. Your Wallet’s default currency is determined by your location, residency or another currency we may elect. If you get any Rewards in a different currency, we’ll convert them to your Wallet’s default currency, or another currency we may elect, using our Currency Conversion Rate.
18. If a Reward was issued because you booked a Travel Experience, any associated Rewards that haven’t been spent will be deleted from your Wallet if that Travel Experience is cancelled.
19. We reserve the right to, without notice, cancel any Reward that was obtained by fraud or misuse.
20. If you think you’ve not received a Reward that you should have, please contact our Customer Service team no more than 12 months after you did whatever it was that you believe qualified you for it. Please provide any supporting documentation you have. If you don’t do this within 12 months, you will automatically be ineligible for the Reward and will not be able to claim it.
21. The validity of all Credits can be found in the Rewards & Wallet activity of your Wallet. If you have any Rewards that may expire soon, we may choose to notify you through emails and push notifications.
For some products/services, the Service Provider will require an Upfront Payment and/or a payment taken during your Travel Experience. Note that if Wallet payments are involved (for example, when you choose to pay later for an Accommodation Booking), we will charge your Wallet for the selected Rewards during booking confirmation – so your Rewards will be spent immediately – while any remaining amount will be charged according to the payment policy of your Booking.
Wallet
22. All data, including personal data, will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Statement and applicable data protection laws and regulations. It will be shared with Group Companies or Service Providers as required by the Wallet programme. Lost, stolen or expired Rewards will not be replaced.
23. Your obligations:
- You’re responsible for making sure that all information is (and stays) correct, complete and up to date
- If we ask you for proof of ID, please provide it within 30 days
- You’re responsible for keeping your Account sign-in details safe and secure in order to safeguard your Wallet.
24. If you don’t follow the rules in this section, we may automatically suspend or cancel your Wallet.
25. You may not use your Wallet or Rewards in any way that is misleading, unfair, harmful or illegal.
26. We may set off or settle any or all of your Rewards against any claim we (or a Group Company) have against you. We may do this at any time, and without advance notice.
27. We may change, suspend or end any aspect of the Wallet or Rewards programme. In particular, we might change:
- these Rewards & Wallet terms
- eligibility criteria
- which Rewards we provide
28. We will make reasonable efforts to give you prior notice if we make any changes or we stop providing the Wallet service altogether.
29. If we stop providing the Wallet service, all Rewards that haven’t expired will be valid for another 12 months.
A15. Intellectual property rights
1. Unless otherwise stated, all rights in our Platform (technology, content, trademarks, look & feel, etc.) are owned by Booking.com (or its licensors) and by using our Platform you agree to do so for its intended purpose only and respecting the requirements set out in paragraphs A15.2 and A15.3.
2. Whether or not you have a commercial purpose, you’re not allowed to access, monitor, copy, scrape/crawl, download, reproduce or otherwise use anything on our Platform using any robot, spider, scraper, other automated means, or automated assistants (including, but not limited to, those that operate by interacting with or otherwise making use of your browser, such as AI-powered assistants) for any purpose without the prior, express written permission of Booking.com. For the avoidance of doubt, Booking.com does not authorize the use of automated means or automated assistants (including, but not limited to, those that operate by interacting with or otherwise making use of your browser, such as AI-powered assistants) to make bookings or reservations using anything on our Platform without the prior, express written permission of Booking.com.
3. We keep a close eye on every visit to our Platform, and we’ll block anyone (and any automated system) we suspect of:
- conducting an unreasonable amount of searches
- using any device or software to gather prices or other information
- doing anything that places undue stress on our Platform
- using automated assistants (including AI-powered assistants) to access the Platform without express permission
4. By uploading a review/picture to our Platform, you’re confirming that it meets our Content Standards and Guidelines and that:
- it’s truthful (you haven’t altered the picture, for example, or uploaded a picture of a different property)
- it doesn’t contain any viruses
- you’re allowed to share it with us
- you own (or are allowed to use) any intellectual property rights that it contains
- we’re allowed to use it on our Platform and for any other commercial purposes (including marketing and advertising), on any media, worldwide – unless you ask us to stop using it
- it doesn’t infringe the privacy rights of other people
- you accept full responsibility for any legal claims against Booking.com related to it.
5. Just to make it clear: we’re not responsible and liable for any picture uploaded to our Platform, we’re allowed to remove any picture upon our discretion (for instance, if we detect that a picture does not meet the criteria).
A16. What if something goes wrong?
1. If you have a query or complaint, please contact our Customer Service team. You can do so by sending mail to our postal address (Postbus 1639, 1000 BP, Netherlands), or through our Help Centre, where you’ll also find useful FAQs, by calling us on our phone numbers, or sending us a message. You can help us help you as quickly as possible by providing, if available:
- your booking confirmation number, your contact details, your reservation PIN code and the email address you used when you made your booking (if you have one)
- a summary of the issue, including how you’d like us to help you
- any supporting documents (bank statement, pictures, receipts, etc.)
2. All queries and complaints are recorded in an identifiable way, allowing you to easily track their status.The most urgent ones are treated as highest priority.
3. If you're a resident of the European Economic Area and you’re not happy with the way we handle your complaint, you may be able to complain via the European Commission's ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) platform (ec.europa.eu/odr). It depends on what your complaint was about:
- if it was about an accommodation, flight or attraction, you can use that ODR platform
- if it was about ground transport, you can’t (because ground transport is booked with Booking.com Transport Limited, and the UK has left the EU).
Please note that you will not be able to submit any new claims via the ODR from 20 March 2025, the day the ODR will be discontinued. For more information on the discontinuation of the ODR, please check out the European Commission’s website.
4. If you’re a resident of the Czech Republic and you’re not happy with the way we handle your complaint, you can complain to the Czech Trade Inspection Authority – Central Inspectorate, ADR Department, registered office Štěpánská 15, Prague 2, postal code: 120 00, email: adr@coi.cz, https://www.coi.cz/informace-o-adr/.
5. If you’re a resident of Brazil and you're not happy with the way we handle your complaint, you can complain via the Brazilian Federal Consumer Dispute Resolution Platform (consumidor.gov.br/).
6. We do try to resolve disputes with you directly. In addition, if you are in the European Union and we have applied “content actions” to your content or account as described in our Content Standards and Guidelines, you may raise a dispute through an out-of-court dispute settlement provider. If you wish to do so, please check a list of such providers, and visit each provider’s website for more information on how their process works. Their decisions are not binding on us. Otherwise, we’re not obliged to submit to any alternative dispute resolution procedures handled by independent providers.
7. You may also bring legal proceedings before a competent court – please refer to ‘Applicable law and forum’ (A20) for details.
A17. Communication with the Service Provider
1. We may help you communicate with your Service Provider, but that doesn’t mean we’re taking responsibility for the Travel Experience or anything the Service Provider does/doesn’t do. We can’t guarantee that they will read anything from you or that they’ll do what you ask. In itself, the fact that you contact them or they contact you doesn’t mean you have any grounds for legal action. If you need help, please contact us via our Help Centre.
A18. Measures against unacceptable behaviour
1. If you breach these Terms (including our values and our Content standards and guidelines) or fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we have the right to:
- stop you making any bookings,
- cancel any bookings you’ve already made,
stop you using:
- our Platform,
- our Customer Service,
- your Account
2. If we cancel a booking as a result, you may not (depending on the circumstances) be entitled to a refund. We may tell you why we've cancelled your booking, unless telling you would (a) contravene applicable laws and/or (b) prevent or obstruct the detection or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities. If you believe we have incorrectly cancelled your booking, please contact our Customer Service team.
3. You acknowledge and agree that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy at law for the unauthorised use of automated means or automated assistants (including, but not limited to, those that operate by interacting with or otherwise making use of your browser, such as AI-powered assistants), that such unauthorised use may cause Booking.com irreparable harm, and that Booking.com is entitled to injunctive relief to prohibit such unauthorised use.
A19. Limitation of liability
1. Nothing in these Terms will limit our (or the Service Provider’s) liability (i) when we (or they) were negligent and this led to death or personal injury; (ii) in case of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; (iii) in respect of gross negligence or wilful misconduct; or (iv) if such liability can otherwise not lawfully be limited or excluded.
2. If you are in breach of these Terms and/or the Service Provider’s terms, we won’t be liable for any costs you incur as a result.
3. We are not liable for:
- any losses or damages which were not reasonably foreseeable when you made your booking or otherwise entered into these Terms; or
- any event which was reasonably beyond our control,
- mistake in an email address, phone number or credit card number (unless it’s our fault).
4. We make no promises about the Service Provider’s products and services other than those expressly stated in these Terms, for example, in Section A4.
5. To the extent permitted by law, the most that we (or any Service Provider) will be liable for (whether for one event or a series of connected events) is your reasonably foreseeable losses or damages in connection to your Booking(s).
6. Just to be clear, these Terms are between you and us. Nothing in these Terms will entitle any third party other than the Service Provider to anything.
7. You may be protected by mandatory consumer protection laws and regulations, which guarantee you rights that no company’s terms can overrule. If there is any inconsistency between those laws and regulations and these Terms, such mandatory consumer protection laws and regulations will override.
A20. Applicable law and forum
1. These Terms are governed by Dutch law (for accommodations, flights or attractions) or English law (for car rentals and private/public transport). You can also rely on your national consumer law if you are a consumer living in a country in the European Economic Area, UK or Switzerland (‘Europe’).
If you are a consumer living outside Europe, to the extent permitted by mandatory local (consumer) law, these Terms are governed by Dutch law (for accommodations, flights or attractions) or English law (for car rentals and private/public transport).
2. If you are a consumer living in Europe (as previously defined):
You may bring a legal action against us:
- in the courts of the country where you live, or
- in the courts in Amsterdam (for accommodations, flights or attractions) or England and Wales (for car rentals and private/public transport).
- We may bring legal action against you in the courts of the country where you live.
If you are a consumer living outside Europe, to the extent permitted by mandatory local (consumer) law, any dispute will exclusively be submitted to the court in Amsterdam (for accommodations, flights or attractions) or England and Wales (for car rentals and private/public transport).
A21. Linked travel arrangements
1. If:
- after selecting and paying for one travel service, you book additional travel services for your trip or holiday during the same visit to the Platform; or
- you book additional travel services for your trip or holiday via a link provided to you by us not later than 24 hours after receiving confirmation of your initial booking with us,
you will NOT benefit from rights applying to packages under the EU’s Directive (EU) 2015/2302 or the UK's Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 (together, the ‘Package Travel Requirements’). Therefore, we will not be responsible for the proper performance of those travel services. In case of problems, please contact the relevant Service Provider.
2. In either of these cases, if you are located in the UK or EU country when booking additional services as previously described, the travel services will become part of a Linked Travel Arrangement and not a package.

A22. Modification clause
1. We may make changes to these Terms. Where such changes are material, we will inform you in advance of such changes becoming effective, unless the changes are required by applicable law.
2. If you do not accept the changes, please do not use our Platform.
3. Otherwise, your continued use of our Platform after the effective date of the proposed changes will constitute your acceptance of the revised Terms.
4. Any existing bookings will continue to be governed by the Terms that applied when the booking was made.
B. Accommodations
B1. Scope of this section
1. This section contains the specific terms for Accommodations products and services. It applies as well as section A (which applies to all Travel Experiences).
B2. Contractual relationship
1. When you make (or request) a booking, it’s directly with the Service Provider – we’re not a ‘contractual party'.
2. Booking.com B.V. owns and operates the Platform.
3. Our Platform only shows Accommodations that have a commercial relationship with us (in some cases, through a partner company – please refer to ‘Partner offer’ under B7.2) or with our Connectivity Providers, and it doesn’t necessarily show all their products or services.
4. Information about Service Providers (e.g. facilities, house rules and sustainability measures) and their Travel Experiences (e.g. prices, availability and cancellation policies) is based on what they provide to us.
B3. What we will do
1. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Accommodations – and you can search for, compare and book them. We offer a personalised experience based on how you use our Platform (including what you tell us) so you can book your ideal Accommodation with us. Our Platform allows you to discover Accommodations all over the world, and our search results make it easy to find the one that’s right for you.
2. Once you’ve booked your Accommodation, we confirm the details of your booking to both you and the Service Provider, including the names of the guest(s).
3. Depending on the terms of your booking, you may be able to change or cancel it if you want. Please contact us using the Help Centre (available 24 hours a day) if you need help with anything.
B4. What you need to do
1. Fill in all your contact details correctly, so we and/or the Service Provider can provide you with information about your booking and, if necessary, contact you.
2. Read these Terms and the terms displayed during the booking process carefully.
3. Take care of the Accommodation and its furniture, fixtures, electronics and other contents, and leave things in the same state they were when you got there. If anything is broken, damaged or lost, make sure you report it to the staff there (as soon as you can, and certainly before you check out).
4. Maintain the security of the Accommodation and its contents during your stay. So don’t, for example, leave doors or windows unlocked.
B5. Price and payment
1. Check ‘Prices’ (A7) and ‘Payment’ (A8).
B6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds
1. Check ‘Policies’ (A9).
B7. What else do you need to know?
We Price Match
1. We want you to get the best possible price every time. If, after you've booked your Accommodation with us, you find the same Accommodation (with the same conditions) for less on another website, we promise to refund the difference. Just remember to contact us after booking with us. If you file your We Price Match claim via email, you'll need to provide us with a screenshot and a link to the other offer. You can also file a We Price Match claim directly on the phone by reaching out to our Customer Service. In any case, the other offer must be online and available when we check.
We Price Match checklist
- The other offer must be for the same property and accommodation type.
- The other offer must be for the same check in and check out dates.
- The other offer must have the same cancellation policy and conditions.
- The other offer must be for the same number of occupants
- The other offer must have the same add-on / meal plan.
- The better deal must be in the local currency of the property.
When can't you make a claim?
- If the other offer is on a website that doesn’t reveal the property or accommodation type you’ll be staying in until after booking.
- If the other offer is available on an opaque, suspicious and/or likely to be fraudulent website.
- If the other offer is part of a loyalty or rewards program, where the price is reduced by the property or website for actions like repeat business, logging in, using a coupon code, referring others, or any other action that reduces the original price.
- If your current Booking.com reservation is a ‘Partner offer’ (these are labelled as such on our platform and are provided by partner companies) or if you're comparing the other offer to a ‘Partner Offer’ on our platform.
- If you cancel your booking.
- If you book a single-unit property, which by nature cannot be available elsewhere.
- Booking.com reserves the right to make the sole determination regarding a customer's eligibility to receive the price match.
Found your booking cheaper elsewhere?
- Look for ‘Found this room cheaper elsewhere?’ on your confirmation page.
- Validate that the cheaper offer meets all the requirements (review checklist).
- Save the link to the cheaper offer (Example: www.hotel.com/93203920).
- Take a screenshot (or multiple) making sure all the relevant data is captured (review checklist).
- Contact Customer Service.
- After claim validation, we will amend the reservation price (if possible) or provide further instruction for you to claim an after stay refund of the price difference.
- Booking.com reserves the right to make the sole determination regarding a customer's eligibility to receive the price match.
Partner offer
2. Some offers on our Platform are marked as 'Partner offers', which means they come to us through a Booking.com partner company rather than straight from a Service Provider. Unless otherwise indicated, any Partner offer that you reserve:
- Must be paid for at the time of booking
- Can't be modified. However, if it offers free cancellation, you will be able to cancel it for free, as long as you do it in time.
- Can't be combined with any other offers (promotions, incentives or rewards)
- Can't be scored or reviewed on our Platform.
Please note that if you book a Partner Offer, the invoice will be issued by the partner company or the property, not by Booking.com directly.
Price incentives by Booking.com
3. Some of the price reductions are funded by us, not by the Service Provider. We simply pay some of the cost ourselves.
Request to book
4. In some cases, you’ll find a button marked ‘Request to book’ on the property page. If you select this option, we’ll explain how this works (on-screen and/or by email).
Damage policy
5. When you’re booking, you may find that some Service Providers refer to a ‘damage policy’. This means that if anyone in your group loses or damages anything:
- you should inform the Service Provider
- instead of charging you for it directly, the Service Provider will have 14 days to submit a damage payment request through our Platform under your reservation number
if they do, we’ll tell you so you can tell us if you have any comments and whether or not you agree with the charge – and then:
- if you agree, we’ll charge you on their behalf
- if you disagree, we’ll look into it, and if we consider that there is cause for further investigation, we will contact you to discuss the next steps.
6. Under the damage policy, there’s a limit to how much a Service Provider can charge you through our Platform (the limit is displayed while you’re booking). However, the Service Provider can start a legal claim against you outside of the damage policy, in which case the limit doesn’t apply.
7. Any payment you make would be between the Service Provider and you – we’d just be organising it on the Service Provider’s behalf.
8. The damage policy doesn’t relate to general cleaning, ordinary wear and tear, any crimes (such as theft), or any non-physical ‘damages’ (e.g. fines for smoking or bringing pets).
9. The Service Provider might require a ‘damage deposit’ before or at check-in. If they do, we’ll tell you about it while you’re booking – but it has nothing to do with the ‘damage policy’. We won’t be involved in any financial settlement related to damage deposits.
How We Work
10. For information on reviews, ranking, how we make money (and more), please check out How We Work, which is also part of our Terms.
C. Attractions
C1. Scope of this section
1. This section contains the specific terms for Attractions products and services. It applies as well as section A (which applies to all Travel Experiences).
C2. Contractual relationship
1. We do not (re)sell, offer or provide any Attractions on our own behalf – when you book an Attraction, you enter into a contract directly with (a) the Service Provider or (b) a Third-Party Aggregator (if they’re reselling the Attraction), as disclosed during the booking process.
2. We act solely as the Platform and are not involved in the terms of the Service Provider / Third-Party Aggregator. We are not responsible for your ticket and have no liability to you in relation to your booking except as described in these Terms.
C3. What we will do
1. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers and (from time to time) Third-Party Aggregators can promote and sell Travel Experiences – and you can search for, compare and book them.
2. Once you’ve booked your Attraction, we’ll provide you and the Service Provider / Third-Party Aggregator (as applicable) with details of the Booking; if the Service Provider / Third-Party Aggregator needs more than your name, we’ll tell you at the time of booking.
3. Depending on the terms of your booking, you may be able to change or cancel it if you want. Please contact us using the Help Centre (available 24 hours a day) if you need help with anything.
C4. What you need to do
1. You must fill in all your contact details correctly so we and/or the Service Provider / Third-Party Aggregator (as applicable) can provide you with information about your booking and, if necessary, contact you.
2. You must read and agree to comply with our Terms and the terms of the Service Provider / Third-Party Aggregator (which will be displayed at checkout) – and acknowledge that breaching them may lead to additional charges and/or the cancellation of your Booking.
C5. Price and payment
1. When you book an Attraction, we will organise your payment. For details of how this works (including the related rights and obligations), please check ‘Payment’ (A8).
C6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds
1. Please check ‘Policies’ (A9).
C7. What else do you need to know?

D. Car rentals
D1. Scope of this section
1. This section contains the specific terms for Car Rental products and services. It applies as well as section A (which applies to all Travel Experiences).
D2. Contractual relationship
1. The car rental pages on Booking.com and Rentalcars.com are operated by Booking.com Transport Limited. The company is registered in England and Wales (Number: 05179829) at the following address: 6 Goods Yard Street, Manchester, M3 3BG, United Kingdom. VAT number: GB 855349007. This means that you accept that the process of making a booking with Booking.com Transport Limited is governed by these Terms – although your actual rental will be governed by the Rental Agreement with your Service Provider (which you sign at pick-up).
2. When you book a rental, your booking is either (a) with us or (b) directly with the Service Provider. Either way:
- our Terms govern the use of the Platform up until you pick up the rental;
- the Rental Agreement governs the rental itself; when you sign this at the rental counter, you’ll enter a contract with the Service Provider (but you’ll review and accept its key terms while you’re booking your car).
Throughout Section D, ‘Service Provider’ means the rental company that provides the car.
3. In most cases, you’ll get your booking Confirmation as soon as you complete your booking – but if the Service Provider doesn't confirm your rentalimmediately, we won’t take payment or send you your booking Confirmation until they’ve done so.
4. If there’s any mismatch between these Terms and the Rental Agreement, the Rental Agreement will apply.
5. The Main Driver (the person whose details are entered during the booking process) is the only person who can change or cancel the booking or discuss it with us – unless they tell us they nominate someone else to do this.
D3. What we will do
1. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Travel Experiences – and you can search for, compare and book them.
2. We don’t guarantee the precise make and model you’re booking (unless we expressly say so). The phrase ‘or similar’ means you could get a similar car (i.e. the same size, with the same kind of gearbox, etc.). So, the car pictures are illustrative only.
3. Once you’ve booked your rental:
- we’ll give the Service Provider the booking details (e.g. the Main Driver's name and contact phone number)
- we’ll confirm the pick-up information (e.g. the Service Provider's contact details and what you need to take with you).
D4. What you need to do
1. You must provide all the information we need to arrange your booking (contact details, pick-up Time, etc.).
2. You must read and agree to comply with these Terms and the Rental Agreement – and acknowledge that if you breach them:
- you might have to pay additional charges
- your booking might be cancelled
- the counter staff might refuse to hand over the keys at the rental counter.
3. You must check your rental's specific requirements, as many details (driving licence requirements, security deposit size, paperwork needed, payment cards accepted, etc.) vary per rental. So please make sure you carefully read:
- these Terms
- the key terms of the Rental Agreement, which you'll review while you’re booking, and
- the Rental Agreement itself, which you'll receive at pick-up.
4. You must be at the rental counter by your pick-up Time (note that some Service Providers have a pick-up ‘grace period’ in case you are delayed). If you arrive after the pick-up Time (and after the pick-up grace period, if any), the car may no longer be available, and you may not be entitled to a refund from the Service Provider. Please check the Rental Agreement for further information (while you're booking your car, please check 'Important info', which informs you of any grace period and which you accept at checkout). If you think you might be late, it's vital that you contact the Service Provider or us, even if it's because of a flight delay and you’ve provided your flight number.
5. The key terms of your rental tell you what the Main Driver needs at pick-up. You must ensure that when they get to the rental counter, they bring everything they need (e.g. driving licence, any required ID, and a credit card in their own name, with enough available funds to cover the security deposit).
6. You must make sure the Main Driver is both eligible and fit to drive the car.
7. You must show the counter staff each driver's full, valid driving licence, which they must have held for at least 1 year (or longer, in many cases). If any driver has endorsements/points on their licence, let us know as soon as you are aware of this, as the Service Provider may not allow them to drive.
8. You must ensure that any driver with a driving licence issued in England, Scotland or Wales obtains a licence 'check code' no more than 21 days before pick-up.
9. You must ensure that every driver has their own International Driving Permit (if they need one) as well as their driving licence. Note that all drivers must carry their driving licence (and International Driving Permit, if they need one) at all times.
10. You must ensure that every child has an appropriate child seat if they need one.
11. You must, if anything goes wrong during your rental(accident, breakdown, etc.):
- contact the Service Provider
- not authorise any repairs without the Service Provider's consent (unless the Rental Agreement allows this)
- Keep all documentation (repair bills, police reports, etc.) to share with us, the Service Provider, and/or the insurance company.
D5. Price and payment
1. If payment is taken at the time of booking, Booking.com Transport Limited will be the merchant of record. For details of our payment processes, please refer to ‘Payment’ (A8).
Additional costs and fees
2. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a young driver fee for each driver under a certain age (e.g. 25). In some cases, they may charge a senior driver fee for each driver over a certain age (e.g. 65). When booking on our Platform, you must enter the Main Driver's age so we can show you details of any age-related fee(s) – which you would pay at pick-up.
3. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a one-way fee if you drop the car off at a different location. If you intend to do this, you need to enter the drop-off location while booking so we can tell you if it’s possible and show you details of any one-way fee – which you would pay at pick-up.
4. In many cases, the Service Provider will charge a cross-border fee for taking the car to a different country/state/island. If you intend to do this, it's vital you tell us and/or the Service Provider as soon as you can (it must be before pick-up).
5. The price of your rentalis calculated based on 24-hour units, so (e.g.) a 25-hour rental will cost as much as a 48-hour rental.
6. If, after pick-up, you decide you want to keep the car for longer, please contact the Service Provider. They'll tell you how much this would cost, and you'll enter a new contract with them. If you drop the car off late without agreeing on this in advance, they may charge an additional fee as well.
Extras
7. In some cases, you'll pay for any optional extras (child seats, GPS, winter tyres, etc.) when you book your car – in which case, you're guaranteed to get them at pick-up.
8. In other cases, you'll merely request any extras when you book your car – in which case:
- you'll pay for them at pick-up, and
- the Service Provider doesn't guarantee they'll be available for you.
D6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds
1. We go above and beyond our legal obligations. Even though local laws don’t require us to offer specific cancellation rights, we guarantee that we will honour our refund policy if you cancel your Booking.
2. The following ‘Cancellation and Amendments’ terms apply to all bookings apart from where a credit card is required to reserve a pay-at-pick-up booking (the cancellation policy depends on the Service Provider, and details will be made available in the booking funnel); and
- bookings that are labelled ‘non-refundable’ (you cannot amend a non-refundable booking, and you won’t receive a refund if you cancel it).
Cancellations
3. If you cancel:
- MORE THAN 48 hours before your rental is due to start, you’ll receive a full refund.
- LESS THAN 48 hours before, or while you’re at the rental counter, we’ll refund what you paid minus the cost of 3 days of your rental – so there won’t be any refund if your car was booked for 3 days or less.
- AFTER your rental is due to start (or you just don’t turn up) you’ll receive no refund.
4. The counter staff may refuse you the car if (for example):
- You don’t arrive on time
- You are not eligible to rent the car
- You don’t have the documentation you need
- The main driver doesn’t have a credit card in their own name with enough funds available for the car’s security deposit.
For more on your Service Provider’s rules, please refer to the ‘Important Information’ that’s available while booking – or the Rental Agreement that you sign at the counter.
If they refuse you the car, please call us straight away from the rental counter to cancel your booking, and we’ll refund what you paid, minus the cost of 3 days of your rental. If you don’t, the cancellation fee will be the full cost of your rental- unless you can prove that the situation has cost us substantially less than that.
Amendments (changes to your Booking)
5. You can make changes to your booking anytime before you’re due to pick the car up.
6. In most cases, the easiest way to do this is via our app – or our website (under ‘Manage Booking’).
7. There is no administration fee for changing your booking, but any changes you make may affect the rental price. Sometimes, the only way we can change a booking is to cancel it and make another one, in which case we may charge you a cancellation fee on the rental company’s behalf.
8. If changing your booking would change the price or incur a cancellation fee, we will tell you in advance.
Changes made by us
9. If we/the Service Provider need to change your booking (e.g. if the Service Provider can’t provide the car), we’ll tell you as soon as we can. If you don't accept that change, you’ll be entitled to cancel and claim a full refund (no matter how close the start of your rentalis), but we will have no additional liability for any direct or indirect costs you may incur (e.g. hotel rooms or taxis).
D7. What else do you need to know?
General
1. In all cases, drivers must be at least a minimum age to rent or drive a car. In some cases, they must also be below a maximum age. The limit(s) can vary by service provider, location, and type of car.
2. Only eligible drivers whose names appear on the Rental Agreement may drive the car.
3. You must not take the car to a different country/state/island and/or drop it off at a different location without arranging this in advance.
Late pick-up/early drop-off
4. If you pick your car up later (section D4.4) or drop it off earlier than agreed in your booking Confirmation, the Service Provider will not refund you for the 'unused' time.
How We Work
5. For information on reviews, ranking, how we make money (and more), please check out How We Work, which is also part of our Terms.
E. Flights
E1. Scope of this section
1. This section contains the specific terms for Flights products and services. It applies as well as section A (which applies to all Travel Experiences).
E2. Contractual relationship
1. Most Flights on our Platform are provided via a Third-Party Aggregator, which acts as an intermediary to the airline(s).
2. When you make a booking, it’s directly with the airline. We’re not a ‘contractual party’ to your Booking. When booking, you enter into (i) an Intermediation Contract with the Third-Party Aggregator (for the ticket) and (ii) a Contract of Carriage with the airline (for the Flight itself).
3. If you book any extras (additional baggage, insurance, etc.), you’ll enter into a direct contract with the Third-Party Aggregator or another company. We will not be involved in this contract.
4. We act solely as the Platform and are not involved in the Third-Party Terms. We are not responsible for your ticket or any extras you may buy and (to the fullest extent permitted by law) have no liability to you in relation to your Booking.
E3. What we will do
1. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Travel Experiences, and you can search for, compare and book them.
2. Once you’ve booked your Flight, your booking details (e.g. the names of the traveller(s)) will be provided to the Service Provider.
3. Depending on the Contract of Carriage, we may be able to help you change or cancel your booking if you want to do so. Please contact us using the Help Centre (available 24 hours a day) if you need help with anything.
E4. What you need to do
1. You must fill in all your contact details correctly so we and/or the Service Provider can provide you with information about your booking and, if necessary, contact you.
2. You must read and agree to comply with our Terms and the Third-Party Terms (which will be displayed at checkout) – and acknowledge that breaching them may lead to additional charges and/or the cancellation of your Booking.
E5. Price and payment
1. When you book a Flight, your payment will be organised by us, by the Third-Party Aggregator (or a party specified by them), or by a third party such as an airline. For details of how we organise payments (including the related rights and obligations) please check ‘Payment’ (A8).
E6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds
1. You’ll find the cancellation policy in the Contract of Carriage between you and the airline. It’s available while you’re booking your Flight and when your Flight is confirmed (on your ‘Manage Booking’ page).
2. There may be a fee for changing or cancelling your Flight.
3. Airlines reserve the right to reschedule or cancel flights in accordance with the airline's terms & conditions, Contract of Carriage or airline policies.
4. Different tickets from the same airline may have different restrictions or include different services. Please make sure you read the full details provided during the booking process.
5. If you have any questions about changes, cancellations or refunds, please contact our Customer Service team.
E7. What else do you need to know?
Code share
1. Some airlines have ‘code share’ agreements with other airlines. So you may buy your ticket from one airline (your ‘ticketing carrier’) but fly in a plane that’s owned by another airline (your ‘operating carrier’). In most cases like this, you will check in with your operating carrier – but please confirm this with your ticketing carrier ahead of time.
2. While you’re booking your Flight, you’ll be informed if it’s a ‘code share’ Flight.
Airline prohibited practices
3. Most airlines don’t allow people to buy tickets that include flights they don’t intend to use – for example, a round-trip ticket if the person doesn’t intend to use the return flight. For more examples, just enter 'point-beyond ticketing', 'hidden-city ticketing' or 'back-to-back ticketing' into a search engine.
4. When you purchase a Flight, you agree not to do this. If you do this in breach of the airline’s terms (provided when you make your Booking), you will reimburse us for any difference between the cost of your actual journey and the cost of the full journey specified on your ticket(s) if the airline claims this from us.
Use of flight segments
5. Most airlines require customers to use their flights in order. So, if you don’t take your first Flight, your airline may automatically cancel the rest of your itinerary.
6. If your airline allows you to ‘skip’ any flights in your itinerary, please make sure you cancel the flight (s) you don’t want, which is in line with the cancellation policy. Note that you may not be entitled to a full refund (or any refund) for these unused Flights.
One-way tickets
7. If you buy two one-way tickets rather than a single round-trip ticket:
- you’ll be making two separate bookings, each with its own rules and policies
- any changes to one Flight will not affect the other (for example, if your initial Flight is cancelled, you won’t be guaranteed a refund for your second Flight).
8. If you’re travelling abroad, you may need to prove to the Check-in and/or Immigration staff that you have a return Flight (check ‘International travel’ for more on passports, visas, etc).
Charges, taxes and fees
9. Your fare will include any taxes and fees charged by an airline or government (except entry/exit fees – check ‘Entry/exit fees’). You may be responsible for dealing with any retroactive change in the tax rate.
Service fees
10. Depending on which Flight you choose, you may be charged a service fee by us and/or the Third-Party Aggregator.
- Our service fee (if any) is for using our Platform so you can buy a ticket from a Third-Party Aggregator. This fee includes any applicable VAT/GST/similar taxes.
- The Third-Party Aggregator’s service fee (if any) is a fee for using them as intermediary to the airline(s). This fee may include any applicable VAT/GST/similar taxes.
11. The price of your ticket will include any service fee(s).
12. You must act in your role as a private consumer to purchase Flights products and services on our Platform. A private consumer is, as opposed to a business, a natural person who enters into a legal transaction for purposes which are predominantly outside its commercial and/or self-employed activities.
Fees for baggage and other extras
13. Your airline may charge for checked baggage, excess/overweight baggage, priority boarding, allocated seating, onboard entertainment, food and drink and/or airport check-in.
14. If they do, the charge(s) will be on top of the price of your ticket (unless it’s expressly stated that your Flight included the extra(s)).
International travel
15. It’s your responsibility to:
- carry a valid passport and/or visa if required
- comply with any entry requirements
- find out if you need a visa to pass through a country that isn’t your final destination
- check with the relevant embassy in advance to confirm if there’s been any change in passport, visa or entry requirements
- review any warnings or advice from your country of residence/origin before you go to/through a country or region.
16. By arranging travel to or from any location, we are not guaranteeing that it is without risk – and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any resulting damages or losses.
17. It’s not a common practice, but international law allows ‘disinsection’ of aircraft to kill insects. To do this, personnel might spray the aircraft’s cabin with an aerosolised insecticide while passengers are on board, or treat its interior surfaces with a residual insecticide while they’re not on board. Before you travel, we advise you to find out about disinsection, including where it might happen.
Entry/exit fees
18. Your fare will not include any fee that a country or airport charges people entering/leaving the country and that is collected directly at the airport. Before you travel, we advise you to find out if you’ll have to pay this kind of fee.

22. When you buy an ATOL protected flight from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if Booking.com becomes insolvent.
23. The suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where the supplier is not able to do so because of Booking.com insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances, the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations, and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases, it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).
24. If the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate are unable to provide the services listed because of Booking.com insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit, you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be reassigned to another body if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.

F. Private and Public Transport
F1. Scope of this section
1. This section contains the specific terms for Private and Public Transport products and services. It applies as well as section A (which applies to all Travel Experiences).
F2. Contractual relationship
1. When you pre-book Private or Public Transport, your booking will be directly with the Service Provider or via a Third-Party Aggregator who will allocate your booking to a Service Provider. In all cases, our Terms will govern the booking process.
2. Pre-Booked Private Transport. You and the Service Provider both agree to comply with these Terms. By making a booking, you are confirming that you have read and accepted the Service Provider or the Third Party Aggregator's terms (where applicable). Not all Service Providers have their own terms, but you’re welcome to check out all the terms that we’ve been provided.
3. Public Transport. You’ll be provided with the Service Provider’s terms during the booking process. If there is any mismatch between their terms and our Terms, their terms will apply.
F3. What we will do
1. We provide the Platform on which Service Providers can promote and sell their Travel Experiences – and you can search for, compare and book them.
2. Once you’ve made your booking, we’ll give the Service Provider your details (e.g. your name, phone number and pick-up location).
3. All Private Transport. We’ll give you the Service Provider's contact details.
4. Pre-Booked Private Transport. We’ll make sure the Service Provider knows what size of vehicle you’ve requested.
5. Public Transport. We’ll give you (or tell you how to collect) your ticket(s).
F4. What you need to do
1. You must check the details of your booking carefully, and provide all the information we need to arrange your booking (your requirements, contact details, etc.).
2. You must make sure everyone in your group complies with our Terms and (where applicable) the Service Provider’s terms, which you saw and accepted during the booking process. You acknowledge that if you breach them:
- you might have to pay additional charges
- your booking might be cancelled
- your driver may refuse to transport you.
3. You must bear in mind that estimated journey times don’t take traffic conditions into account.
4. All Private Transport. You must make sure all passengers are at the pick-up location on time.
5. All Private Transport. At and around your pick-up Time, you must have the phone (whose number you entered when you made your Booking) switched on and able to receive calls/texts, in case the driver needs to contact you. We can't guarantee they’ll be able to reach you through messaging applications such as WhatsApp or Viber.
6. Pre-Booked Private Transport. For any airport pick-up, you must give us your flight details at least 24 hours before your pick-up Time so your Service Provider can adjust the pick-up Time if your flight is delayed. If they can’t provide a Private Transport following a flight delay or cancellation, please contact our Customer Service team.
7. Public Transport. You must make sure all passengers arrive on time, leaving enough time to collect tickets if necessary.
8. You must be 18 or older to make a booking, and any passenger under 18 must be accompanied by a responsible adult.
9. You must make sure no passenger behaves inappropriately – e.g. being abusive or doing anything that might endanger someone.
10. You must make sure you choose Public/Private Transport that’s suitable (in terms of party size, amount of luggage, accessibility requirements, etc.).
F5. Price and payment
1. Booking.com Transport Limited will arrange the payment for your Booking. For details of our payment process, please refer to ‘Payment’ (A8).
2. Pre-Booked Private Transport. Price includes any tolls, congestion charges, taxes and peak surcharges. Payment is taken at the time of booking. Price for Shared Pre-Booked Private Transport Services will be per seat.
3. Public Transport. Payment is taken when your booking is confirmed. Before departure, the Service Provider may need to check your ticket(s)/e-ticket(s). Please keep it/them with you at all times, or you might have to pay again.
4. The Service Provider/driver doesn’t have to agree to any changes to the Journey that you request in person. If they do, they may charge extra.
F6. Amendments, cancellations and refunds
Cancellation
1. In most cases:
- Pre-Booked Private Transport. You can cancel for free up to 24 hours before your pick-up time (2 hours in some cases – please review your confirmation). If you don't cancel on time, you won't be entitled to a refund.
- Public Transport. You won’t be entitled to a refund once your booking is confirmed. If your plans change, please contact our Customer Service team to discuss any options that might be available.
2. If your Service Provider or Third Party Aggregator has a different cancellation policy (which you’ll review while booking), their policy will apply instead.
3. We and/or the Service Provider may cancel the booking with little or no notice – but this would only happen in very specific situations. For example, if:
- the Service Provider becomes insolvent or is genuinely unable to honour your booking – in which case we'll do our best to arrange alternative transport (and we'll refund you in full if we can't)
- you are in breach of these Terms and/or the Service Provider's terms – in which case you may not be entitled to a refund.
4. Where multiple tickets have been purchased for Shared Pre-Booked Private Transport, if you cancel, all tickets will be cancelled.
Amendments (changes) before your Journey begins
5. Pre-Booked Private Transport. Your confirmation email will tell you how much notice you need to give (ahead of your pick-up Time) to request any changes to your booking (such as location or time).
6. Public Transport. You cannot change your booking once it's confirmed.
7. If we/the Service Provider need to change your booking (for example, if there’s a strike that interferes with your journey), we’ll tell you as soon as we can. If you then decide to cancel:
- Any Transport. Unless you cancel for one of the reasons in the next bullet, you’ll be entitled to a full refund (no matter how close your journey is).
- Any Private Transport. If the change is simply a new driver, a new Service Provider, or a new (similar) vehicle, you won’t be entitled to a refund (unless you’re cancelling with enough notice).
Either way, neither we nor the Service Provider will be liable for any costs you may incur (e.g. alternative transport or hotel rooms).
8. Where multiple tickets have been purchased for Shared Pre-Booked Private Transport, if you amend the booking, all tickets will be amended.
Refunds
9. If you wish to apply for a refund, you must do so in writing no more than 14 days after your pick-up Time.
10. Any refund may take up to 5 working days to arrive in your account.
11. All Private Transport. If your driver isn’t at the pick-up location on time, you can apply for a refund, and we’ll investigate this for you.
12. All Private Transport. You won't be entitled to a refund if your Journey doesn't go ahead as planned because:
- the driver/Service Provider can't contact you
- one or more passengers aren't at the pick-up location on time, and you haven't requested a new pick-up Time
- you request unreasonable changes to the pick-up Time or Journey
- you don’t tell us / the Service Provider / the driver about a change you want to make
- you provided incorrect details when booking your Private Transport (pick-up location, contact details, number of people, amount of luggage, etc.).
F7. What else do you need to know?
Pre-Booked Private Transport
1. Please review your confirmation email to check how long the driver will wait at the pick-up location.
Repair or cleaning charges
2. If anything needs to be repaired or cleaned because someone in your group has done something unreasonable or is in breach of these Terms, you will be responsible for the cost of repairs/cleaning.
